# Markdown style guide
Much of what makes Markdown refreshing is the ability to write plain text and get great formatted output as a result. 
To keep the slate clean for the next author, your Markdown should be simple and consistent with the whole corpus 
wherever possible.

We seek to balance three goals:

1. Source text is readable and portable.
2. The Markdown corpus is maintainable over time and across teams.
3. The syntax is simple and easy to remember.

## Minimum viable documentation
A small set of fresh and accurate docs is better than a sprawling, 
loose assembly of “documentation” in various states of disrepair.

The **Markdown way** encourages engineers to take ownership of their docs and keep them up to date with the same 
zeal we keep our tests in good order. Strive for this.

* Identify what you really need: release docs, API docs, testing guidelines.
* Delete cruft frequently and in small batches.

## Better is better than best
The standards for an internal documentation review are different from the standards for code reviews.
Reviewers should ask for improvements, but in general, the author should always be able to invoke the “Better/Best Rule.”

Fast iteration is your friend. 
To get long-term improvement, **authors must stay productive** when making short-term improvements. 
Set lower standards for each CL, so that more such CLs can happen.

As a reviewer of a documentation CL:

* When reasonable, LGTM immediately and trust that comments will be fixed appropriately.
* Prefer to suggest an alternative rather than leaving a vague comment.
* For substantial changes, start your own follow-up CL instead. Especially try to avoid comments of the form “You should also…”.
* On rare occasions, hold up submission if the CL actually makes the docs worse. It’s okay to ask the author to revert.

As an author:

* Avoid wasting cycles with trivial argument. Capitulate early and move on.
* Cite the Better/Best Rule as often as needed.

## Capitalization
Use the original names of products, tools and binaries, preserving the capitalization. E.g.:

```md
# Markdown style guide

`Markdown` is a dead-simple platform for internal engineering documentation.
```

and not

```md
# markdown bad style guide example

`markdown` is a dead-simple platform for internal engineering documentation.
```

## Document layout
In general, documents benefit from some variation of the following layout:

```md
# Document Title

Short introduction.

[TOC]

## Topic

Content.

## See also

* https://link-to-more-info
```

1. `# Document title`: The first heading should be a level-one heading, ideally the same or nearly the same as the 
   filename. The first level-one heading is used as the page `<title>`.
2. `author`: Optional. If you’d like to claim ownership of the document or if you are very proud of it, 
   add yourself under the title. However, revision history generally suffices.
    - Pinot style: do not include author information.
3. `Short introduction`. 1–3 sentences providing a high-level overview of the topic. 
   Imagine yourself as a complete newbie who landed on your “Extending Foo” doc and doesn’t know the most basic 
   information you take for granted. “What is Foo? Why would I extend it?”
4. `[TOC]`: if you use hosting that supports table of contents, such as Gitiles, put `[TOC]` after the short introduction.
   See [TOC] documentation.
    - Pinot style: MkDocs automatically transforms `[TOC]` into a table of contents.
5. `## Topic`: The rest of your headings should start from level 2.
6. `## See also`: Put miscellaneous links at the bottom for the user who wants to know more or didn’t find what they 
   needed.

## Table of contents
### Use a `[TOC]` directive
Use a `[TOC]` directive unless all of your content is above the fold1 on a laptop.

### Place the `[TOC]` directive after the introduction
Place the `[TOC]` directive after your page’s introduction and before the first H2 heading. For example:

```md
# My Page

This is my introduction **before** the TOC.

[TOC]

## My first H2
```
```md
# My Page

[TOC]

This is my introduction **after** the TOC where it should not be.

## My first H2
```

For users who read your documentation visually, it doesn’t matter where your `[TOC]` directive is placed, as Markdown 
always displays the TOC toward the top and to the right of the page. 
However, `[TOC]` placement matters a lot when screen readers or keyboard controls are involved.

That’s because `[TOC]` inserts the HTML for the table of contents into the DOM wherever you’ve included the directive 
in your Markdown file. 
If, for example, you place the directive at the very bottom of your file, screen readers won’t read it until they get to
the end of the document.

## Character line limit
Markdown content follows the residual convention of an 120-character line limit. 
Why? Because it’s what most of us do for code.

Pinot style: Notice that Google style guide uses 80-character line limit, while Pinot uses 120-character line limit.

* **Tooling integration**: All our tooling is designed around code, so the more our documents are formatted according to
  similar rules, the better these tools will work. For example, Code Search doesn’t soft wrap.

* **Quality**. The more engineers use their well-worn coding habits when creating and editing Markdown content,
  the better the quality. Markdown takes advantage of the excellent review culture we already have.

### Exceptions
Exceptions to the 120-character rule include:

* Links
* Tables
* Headings
* Code blocks

This means that lines with links are allowed to extend past column 80, along with any relevant punctuation:
```md
*   See the
    [foo docs](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/+/HEAD/Documentation/markdown.md).
    and find the logfile.
    However, note that text before and after the link gets wrapped.
```

Tables may also run long. However, there are best practices for creating short, readable tables.

```md
Foo                                                                           | Bar | Baz
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---
Somehow-unavoidable-long-cell-filled-with-content-that-simply-refuses-to-wrap | Foo | Bar
```

## Trailing whitespace
Don’t use trailing whitespace. Use a trailing backslash to break lines.

The CommonMark spec decrees that two spaces at the end of a line should insert a <br /> tag. 
However, many directories have a presubmit check for trailing whitespace, and many IDEs will clean it up anyway.

Use a trailing backslash, sparingly:
```md
For some reason I just really want a break here,\
though it's probably not necessary.
```

Best practice is to avoid the need for a <br /> altogether. 
A pair of newlines will create a paragraph tag; get used to that.

## Headings
ATX-style headings
```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

Headings with `=` or `-` underlines can be annoying to maintain and don’t fit with the rest of the heading syntax. 
An editor has to ask: Does --- mean H1 or H2?

```md
Heading - do you remember what level? DO NOT DO THIS.
---------
```

## Use unique, complete names for headings
Use unique and fully descriptive names for each heading, even for sub-sections.
Since link anchors are constructed from headings, this helps ensure that the automatically-constructed anchor links are
intuitive and clear.

For example, instead of:

```md
## Foo
### Summary
### Example
## Bar
### Summary
### Example
```
prefer:

```md
## Foo
### Foo summary
### Foo example
## Bar
### Bar summary
### Bar example
```

## Add spacing to headings
Prefer spacing after # and newlines before and after:

```md
...text before.

## Heading 2

Text after...
```

Lack of spacing makes it a little harder to read in source:

```md
...text before.

##Heading 2
Text after... DO NOT DO THIS.
```

## Use a single H1 heading
Use one H1 heading as the title of your document. Subsequent headings should be H2 or deeper. 
See Document layout for more information.

## Capitalization of titles and headers
Follow the guidance for capitalization in the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide.

## Lists
Use lazy numbering for long lists
Markdown is smart enough to let the resulting HTML render your numbered lists correctly.
For longer lists that may change, especially long nested lists, use “lazy” numbering:

```md
1.  Foo.
1.  Bar.
    1.  Foofoo.
    1.  Barbar.
1.  Baz.
```

However, if the list is small and you don’t anticipate changing it, prefer fully numbered lists, 
because it’s nicer to read in source:

```md
1.  Foo.
2.  Bar.
3.  Baz.
```

## Nested list spacing
When nesting lists, use a 4-space indent for both numbered and bulleted lists:

```md
1.  Use 2 spaces after the item number, so the text itself is indented 4 spaces.
    Use a 4-space indent for wrapped text.
2.  Use 2 spaces again for the next item.

*   Use 3 spaces after a bullet, so the text itself is indented 4 spaces.
    Use a 4-space indent for wrapped text.
    1.  Use 2 spaces with numbered lists, as before.
        Wrapped text in a nested list needs an 8-space indent.
    2.  Looks nice, doesn't it?
*   Back to the bulleted list, indented 3 spaces.
```

The following works, but it’s very messy:

```md
* One space,
  with no indent for wrapped text.
    1. Irregular nesting... DO NOT DO THIS.
```

Even when there’s no nesting, using the 4 space indent makes layout consistent for wrapped text:

```md
*   Foo,
    wrapped with a 4-space indent.

1.  Two spaces for the list item
    and 4 spaces before wrapped text.
2.  Back to 2 spaces.
```

However, when lists are small, not nested, and a single line, one space can suffice for both kinds of lists:

```md
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz.

1. Foo.
2. Bar.
```

## Code
### Inline
``Backticks`` designate inline code that will be rendered literally. 
Use them for short code quotations, field names, and more:

```md
You'll want to run `really_cool_script.sh arg`.

Pay attention to the `foo_bar_whammy` field in that table.
```

Use inline code when referring to file types in a generic sense, rather than a specific existing file:
```md
Be sure to update your `README.md`!
```

### Use code span for escaping
When you don’t want text to be processed as normal Markdown, like a fake path or example URL that would lead to a bad autolink, wrap it in backticks:

```md
An example Markdown shortlink would be: `Markdown/foo/Markdown/bar.md`

An example query might be: `https://www.google.com/search?q=$TERM`
```

### Codeblocks
For code quotations longer than a single line, use a fenced code block:

```python
def Foo(self, bar):
  self.bar = bar
```

#### Declare the language
It is best practice to explicitly declare the language, so that neither the syntax highlighter nor the next editor 
must guess.

#### Use fenced code blocks instead of indented code blocks
Four-space indenting is also interpreted as a code block. However, we strongly recommend fencing for all code blocks.

Indented code blocks can sometimes look cleaner in the source, but they have several drawbacks:

* You cannot specify the language. Some Markdown features are tied to language specifiers.
* The beginning and end of the code block are ambiguous.
* Indented code blocks are harder to search for in Code Search.

```
You'll need to run:

    bazel run :thing -- --foo

And then:

    bazel run :another_thing -- --bar

And again:

    bazel run :yet_again -- --baz
```

#### Escape newlines
Because most command-line snippets are intended to be copied and pasted directly into a terminal, 
it’s best practice to escape any newlines. Use a single backslash at the end of the line:

```shell
$ bazel run :target -- --flag --foo=longlonglonglonglongvalue \
  --bar=anotherlonglonglonglonglonglonglonglonglonglongvalue
```

#### Nest codeblocks within lists
If you need a code block within a list, make sure to indent it so as to not break the list:

```md
*   Bullet.

    ```c++
    int foo;
    ```

*   Next bullet
```

You can also create a nested code block with 4 spaces. Simply indent 4 additional spaces from the list indentation:
```md
*   Bullet.

        int foo;

*   Next bullet.
```

## Links
Long links make source Markdown difficult to read and break the 120 character wrapping. 
Wherever possible, shorten your links.

### Use explicit paths for links within Markdown
Use the explicit path for Markdown links. For example:

```md
[...](/path/to/other/markdown/page.md)
```
You don’t need to use the entire qualified URL:

```md 
[...](https://bad-full-url.example.com/path/to/other/markdown/page.md)
```

### Avoid relative paths unless within the same directory
Relative paths are fairly safe within the same directory. For example:

```md
[...](other-page-in-same-dir.md)
[...](/path/to/another/dir/other-page.md)
```
Avoid relative links if you need to specify other directories with `../`:
```md
[...](../../bad/path/to/another/dir/other-page.md)
```

### Use informative Markdown link titles
Markdown link syntax allows you to set a link title. Use it wisely. Users often do not read documents; they scan them.

Links catch the eye. But titling your links “here,” “link,” or simply duplicating the target URL tells the hasty reader
precisely nothing and is a waste of space:

```md
DO NOT DO THIS.

See the Markdown guide for more info: [link](markdown.md), or check out the
style guide [here](/styleguide/docguide/style.html).

Check out a typical test result:
[https://example.com/foo/bar](https://example.com/foo/bar).
```

Instead, write the sentence naturally, then go back and wrap the most appropriate phrase with the link:

```md
See the [Markdown guide](markdown.md) for more info, or check out the
[style guide](/styleguide/docguide/style.html).

Check out a
[typical test result](https://example.com/foo/bar).
```

### Reference
For long links or image URLs, you may want to split the link use from the link definition, like this:

```md
See the [Markdown style guide][style], which has suggestions for making docs more
readable.

[style]: http://Markdown/corp/Markdown/docs/reference/style.md
```

####  Use reference links for long links
Use reference links where the length of the link would detract from the readability of the surrounding text if it were
inlined. Reference links make it harder to see the destination of a link in source text, and add additional syntax.

In this example, reference link usage is not appropriate, because the link is not long enough to disrupt the flow 
of the text:

```md
DO NOT DO THIS.

The [style guide][style_guide] says not to use reference links unless you have to.

[style_guide]: https://google.com/Markdown-style
```

Just inline it instead:

```md
https://google.com/Markdown-style says not to use reference links unless you have to.
```

In this example, the link destination is long enough that it makes sense to use a reference link:

```md
The [style guide] says not to use reference links unless you have to.

[style guide]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HQBxfhCwx8lVRuN2Wf6poqvAfVeEXmFVcawP5I6B3c/edit
```

Use reference links more often in tables. It is particularly important to keep table content short, since Markdown does
not provide a facility to break text in cell tables across multiple lines, and smaller tables are more readable.

For example, this table’s readability is worsened by inline links:

```md
DO NOT DO THIS.

Site                                                             | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------
[site 1](http://google.com/excessively/long/path/example_site_1) | This is example site 1.
[site 2](http://google.com/excessively/long/path/example_site_2) | This is example site 2.
```

Instead, use reference links to keep the line length manageable:

```md
Site     | Description
-------- | -----------------------
[site 1] | This is example site 1.
[site 2] | This is example site 2.

[site 1]: http://google.com/excessively/long/path/example_site_1
[site 2]: http://google.com/excessively/long/path/example_site_2
```

#### Use reference links to reduce duplication
Consider using reference links when referencing the same link destination multiple times in a document,
to reduce duplication.

#### Define reference links after their first use
We recommend putting reference link definitions just before the next heading, at the end of the section in which they’re
first used. If your editor has its own opinion about where they should go, don’t fight it; the tools always win.

We define a “section” as all text between two headings. Think of reference links like footnotes, and the current section
like the current page.

This arrangement makes it easy to find the link destination in source view, while keeping the flow of text free from 
clutter. In long documents with lots of reference links, it also prevents “footnote overload” at the bottom of the file,
which makes it difficult to pick out the relevant link destination.

There is one exception to this rule: reference link definitions that are used in multiple sections should go at the end
of the document. This avoids dangling links when a section is updated or moved.

In the following example, the reference definition is far from its initial use, which makes the document harder to read:

```md
# Header FOR A BAD DOCUMENT

Some text with a [link][link_def].

Some more text with the same [link][link_def].

## Header 2

... lots of text ...

## Header 3

Some more text using a [different_link][different_link_def].

[link_def]: http://reallyreallyreallylonglink.com
[different_link_def]: http://differentreallyreallylonglink.com
```

Instead, put it just before the header following its first use:

```md
# Header

Some text with a [link][link_def].

Some more text with the same [link][link_def].

[link_def]: http://reallyreallyreallylonglink.com

## Header 2

... lots of text ...

## Header 3

Some more text using a [different_link][different_link_def].

[different_link_def]: http://differentreallyreallylonglink.com
```

## Images
See [image syntax](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/+/HEAD/Documentation/markdown.md#Images).

Use images sparingly, and prefer simple screenshots. 
This guide is designed around the idea that plain text gets users down to the business of communication faster with
less reader distraction and author procrastination. However, it’s sometimes very helpful to show what you mean.

Use images when it’s easier to show a reader something than to describe it. For example, explaining how to navigate a UI
is often easier with an image than text.
Make sure to provide appropriate text to describe your image. Readers who are not sighted cannot see your image and 
still need to understand the content! See the alt text best practices below. 

## Tables
Use tables when they make sense: for the presentation of tabular data that needs to be scanned quickly.

Avoid using tables when your data could easily be presented in a list. Lists are much easier to write and read in Markdown.

For example:

```md
DO NOT DO THIS

Fruit  | Metrics      | Grows on | Acute curvature    | Attributes                                                                                                  | Notes
------ | ------------ | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apple  | Very popular | Trees    |                    | [Juicy](http://cs/SomeReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLongQuery), Firm, Sweet               | Apples keep doctors away.
Banana | Very popular | Trees    | 16 degrees average | [Convenient](http://cs/SomeDifferentReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLongQuery), Soft, Sweet | Contrary to popular belief, most apes prefer mangoes. Don't you? See the [design doc][banana_v2] for the newest hotness in bananiels.
```

This table illustrates a few typical problems:

* Poor distribution: Several columns don’t differ across rows, and some cells are empty. 
This is usually a sign that your data may not benefit from tabular display.

* Unbalanced dimensions: There are a small number of rows relative to columns. 
When this ratio is unbalanced in either direction, a table becomes little more than an inflexible format for text.

* Rambling prose in some cells. Tables should tell a succinct story at a glance.

Lists and subheadings sometimes suffice to present the same information. Let’s see this data in list form:

```md
## Fruits

Both types are highly popular, sweet, and grow on trees.

### Apple

*   [Juicy](http://SomeReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLongURL)
*   Firm

Apples keep doctors away.

### Banana

*   [Convenient](http://cs/SomeDifferentReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLongQuery)
*   Soft
*   16 degrees average acute curvature.

Contrary to popular belief, most apes prefer mangoes. Don't you?

See the [design doc][banana_v2] for the newest hotness in bananiels.
```

The list form is more spacious, and arguably therefore much easier for the reader to find what interests her in this 
case.

However, there are times a table is the best choice. When you have:

* Relatively uniform data distribution across two dimensions.
* Many parallel items with distinct attributes.

In those cases, a table format is just the thing. In fact, a compact table can improve readability:

```md
Transport        | Favored by     | Advantages
---------------- | -------------- | -----------------------------------------------
Swallow          | Coconuts       | [Fast when unladen][airspeed]
Bicycle          | Miss Gulch     | [Weatherproof][tornado_proofing]
X-34 landspeeder | Whiny farmboys | [Cheap][tosche_station] since the XP-38 came out

[airspeed]: http://google3/airspeed.h
[tornado_proofing]: http://google3/kansas/
[tosche_station]: http://google3/power_converter.h
```

Note that reference links are used to keep the table cells manageable.

## Strongly prefer Markdown to HTML
Please prefer standard Markdown syntax wherever possible and avoid HTML hacks. 
If you can’t seem to accomplish what you want, reconsider whether you really need it. 
Except for big tables, Markdown meets almost all needs already.

Every bit of HTML hacking reduces the readability and portability of our Markdown corpus. 
This in turn limits the usefulness of integrations with other tools, which may either present the source as plain
text or render it. See Philosophy.

Gitiles does not render HTML.

Content is “above the fold” if it is visible when the page is first displayed. Content is “below the fold” if it is hidden until the user scrolls down the page on a computer or literally unfolds a document such as a newspaper. ↩
