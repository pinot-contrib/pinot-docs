# Text search support

## Why do we need text search?

Pinot supports super-fast query processing through its indexes on non-BLOB like columns. Queries with exact match filters are run efficiently through a combination of dictionary encoding, inverted index, and sorted index.

This is useful for a query like the following, which looks for exact matches on two columns of type STRING and INT respectively:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Foo 
WHERE STRING_COL = 'ABCDCD' 
AND INT_COL > 2000
```

For arbitrary text data that falls into the BLOB/CLOB territory, we need more than exact matches. This often involves using regex, phrase, fuzzy queries on BLOB like data. Text indexes can efficiently perform arbitrary search on STRING columns where each column value is a large BLOB of text using the `TEXT_MATCH` function, like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Foo 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH (<column_name>, '<search_expression>')
```

where `<column_name>` is the column text index is created on and `<search_expression>` conforms to one of the following:

| **Search Expression Type** | **Example**                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Phrase query               | TEXT\_MATCH (\<column\_name>, '"distributed system"') |
| Term Query                 | TEXT\_MATCH (\<column\_name>, 'Java')                 |
| Boolean Query              | TEXT\_MATCH (\<column\_name>, 'Java AND c++')         |
| Prefix Query               | TEXT\_MATCH (\<column\_name>, 'stream\*')             |
| Regex Query                | TEXT\_MATCH (\<column\_name>, '/Exception.\*/')       |

## Current restrictions

Pinot supports text search with the following requirements:

* The column type should be STRING.
* The column should be single-valued.
* Using a text index in coexistence with other Pinot indexes is not supported.

## Sample Datasets

Text search should ideally be used on STRING columns where doing standard filter operations (EQUALITY, RANGE, BETWEEN) doesn't fit the bill because each column value is a reasonably large blob of text.

### Apache Access Log

Consider the following snippet from an Apache access log. Each line in the log consists of arbitrary data (IP addresses, URLs, timestamps, symbols etc) and represents a column value. Data like this is a good candidate for doing text search.

Let's say the following snippet of data is stored in the `ACCESS\_LOG\_COL` column in a Pinot table.

```log
109.169.248.247 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:25:11 +0100] "GET /administrator/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4263 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-
109.169.248.247 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:25:11 +0100] "POST /administrator/index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 4494 "http://almhuette-raith.at/administrator/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"

46.72.177.4 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:31:08 +0100] "POST /administrator/index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 4494 "http://almhuette-raith.at/administrator/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"
83.167.113.100 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:31:25 +0100] "GET /administrator/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4263 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"
83.167.113.100 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:31:25 +0100] "POST /administrator/index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 4494 "http://almhuette-raith.at/administrator/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"

109.184.11.34 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:32:56 +0100] "GET /administrator/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4263 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"
109.184.11.34 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:32:56 +0100] "POST /administrator/index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 4494 "http://almhuette-raith.at/administrator/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"
91.227.29.79 - - [12/Dec/2015:18:33:51 +0100] "GET /administrator/ HTTP/1.1" 200 4263 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0" "-"
```

Here are some examples of search queries on this data:

**Count the number of GET requests.**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(ACCESS_LOG_COL, 'GET')
```

**Count the number of POST requests that have administrator in the URL (administrator/index)**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(ACCESS_LOG_COL, 'post AND administrator AND index')
```

**Count the number of POST requests that have a particular URL and handled by Firefox browser**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(ACCESS_LOG_COL, 'post AND administrator AND index AND firefox')
```

### Resume text

Let's consider another example using text from job candidate resumes. Each line in this file represents skill-data from resumes of different candidates.

This data is stored in the `SKILLS\_COL` column in a Pinot table. Each line in the input text represents a column value.

```csv

```

Here are some examples of search queries on this data:

**Count the number of candidates that have "machine learning" and "gpu processing"**: This is a phrase search (more on this further in the document) where we are looking for exact match of phrases "machine learning" and "gpu processing", not necessarily in the same order in the original data.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"Machine learning" AND "gpu processing"')
```

**Count the number of candidates that have "distributed systems" and either 'Java' or 'C++'**: This is a combination of searching for exact phrase "distributed systems" along with other terms.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"distributed systems" AND (Java C++)')
```

### Query Log

Next, consider a snippet from a log file containing SQL queries handled by a database. Each line (query) in the file represents a column value in the `QUERY\_LOG\_COL` column in a Pinot table.

```sql
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560988800000 AND 1568764800000 GROUP BY dimensionCol3 TOP 2500
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560988800000 AND 1568764800000 GROUP BY dimensionCol3 TOP 2500
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1545436800000 AND 1553212800000 GROUP BY dimensionCol3 TOP 2500
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1537228800000 AND 1537660800000 GROUP BY dimensionCol3 TOP 2500
SELECT dimensionCol2, dimensionCol4, timestamp, dimensionCol5, dimensionCol6 FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1561366800000 AND 1561370399999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019062409 LIMIT 10000
SELECT dimensionCol2, dimensionCol4, timestamp, dimensionCol5, dimensionCol6 FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1563807600000 AND 1563811199999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019072215 LIMIT 10000
SELECT dimensionCol2, dimensionCol4, timestamp, dimensionCol5, dimensionCol6 FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1563811200000 AND 1563814799999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019072216 LIMIT 10000
SELECT dimensionCol2, dimensionCol4, timestamp, dimensionCol5, dimensionCol6 FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1566327600000 AND 1566329400000 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019082019 LIMIT 10000
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560834000000 AND 1560837599999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019061805 LIMIT 0
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560870000000 AND 1560871800000 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019061815 LIMIT 0
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560871800001 AND 1560873599999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019061815 LIMIT 0
SELECT count(dimensionCol2) FROM FOO WHERE dimensionCol1 = 18616904 AND timestamp BETWEEN 1560873600000 AND 1560877199999 AND dimensionCol3 = 2019061816 LIMIT 0
```

Here are some examples of search queries on this data:

**Count the number of queries that have GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(QUERY_LOG_COL, '"group by"')
```

**Count the number of queries that have the SELECT count... pattern**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(QUERY_LOG_COL, '"select count"')
```

**Count the number of queries that use BETWEEN filter on timestamp column along with GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(QUERY_LOG_COL, '"timestamp between" AND "group by"')
```

Read on for concrete examples on each kind of query and step-by-step guides covering how to write text search queries in Pinot.

{% hint style="info" %}
A column in Pinot can be dictionary-encoded or stored RAW. In addition, we can create an inverted index and/or a sorted index on a dictionary-encoded column.

The text index is an addition to the type of **per-column indexes** users can create in Pinot. However, it only supports text index on a RAW column, not a dictionary-encoded column.
{% endhint %}

## Enable a text index

Enable a text index on a column in the [table configuration](../../configuration-reference/table.md) by adding a new section with the name "fieldConfigList".

```json
"fieldConfigList":[
  {
     "name":"text_col_1",
     "encodingType":"RAW",
     "indexTypes":["TEXT"]
  },
  {
     "name":"text_col_2",
     "encodingType":"RAW",
     "indexTypes":["TEXT"]
  }
]
```

Each column that has a text index should also be specified as `noDictionaryColumns` in `tableIndexConfig`:

```json
"tableIndexConfig": {
   "noDictionaryColumns": [
     "text_col_1",
     "text_col_2"
 ]}
```

You can configure text indexes in the following scenarios:

* Adding a new table with text index enabled on one or more columns.
* Adding a new column with text index enabled to an existing table.
* Enabling a text index on an existing column.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you're using a text index, add the indexed column to the `noDictionaryColumns` columns list to reduce unnecessary storage overhead.

For instructions on that configuration property, see the [Raw value forward index](forward-index.md#raw-value-forward-index) documentation.
{% endhint %}

## Text index creation

Once the text index is enabled on one or more columns through a [table configuration](../../configuration-reference/table.md), segment generation code will automatically create the text index (per column).

Text index is supported for both offline and real-time segments.

### Text parsing and tokenization

The original text document (denoted by a value in the column that has text index enabled) is parsed, tokenized and individual "indexable" terms are extracted. These terms are inserted into the index.

Pinot's text index is built on top of Lucene. Lucene's **standard english text tokenizer** generally works well for most classes of text. To build a custom text parser and tokenizer to suit particular user requirements, this can be made configurable for the user to specify on a per-column text-index basis.

There is a default set of "stop words" built in Pinot's text index. This is a set of high frequency words in English that are excluded for search efficiency and index size, including:

```csv
"a", "an", "and", "are", "as", "at", "be", "but", "by", "for", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it",
"no", "not", "of", "on", "or", "such", "that", "the", "their", "then", "than", "there", "these", 
"they", "this", "to", "was", "will", "with", "those"
```

Any occurrence of these words will be ignored by the tokenizer during index creation and search.

In some cases, users might want to customize the set. A good example would be when `IT` (Information Technology) appears in the text that collides with "it", or some context-specific words that are not informative in the search. To do this, one can config the words in `fieldConfig` to include/exclude from the default stop words:

```json
"fieldConfigList":[
  {
     "name":"text_col_1",
     "encodingType":"RAW",
     "indexType":"TEXT",
     "properties": {
        "stopWordInclude": "incl1, incl2, incl3",
        "stopWordExclude": "it"
     }
  }
]
```

The words should be **comma separated** and in **lowercase**. Words appearing in both lists will be excluded as expected.

## Writing text search queries

The `TEXT_MATCH` function enables using text search in SQL/PQL.

TEXT\_MATCH(text\_column\_name, search\_expression)

* text\_column\_name - name of the column to do text search on.
* search\_expression - search query

You can use TEXT\_MATCH function as part of queries in the WHERE clause, like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Foo WHERE TEXT_MATCH(...)
SELECT * FROM Foo WHERE TEXT_MATCH(...)
```

You can also use the `TEXT_MATCH` filter clause with other filter operators. For example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Foo WHERE TEXT_MATCH(...) AND some_other_column_1 > 20000
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Foo WHERE TEXT_MATCH(...) AND some_other_column_1 > 20000 AND some_other_column_2 < 100000
```

You can combine multiple `TEXT_MATCH` filter clauses:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Foo WHERE TEXT_MATCH(text_col_1, ....) AND TEXT_MATCH(text_col_2, ...)
```

`TEXT_MATCH` can be used in WHERE clause of all kinds of queries supported by Pinot.

* Selection query which projects one or more columns
  * User can also include the text column name in select list
* Aggregation query
* Aggregation GROUP BY query

The search expression (the second argument to `TEXT_MATCH` function) is the query string that Pinot will use to perform text search on the column's text index.

### Phrase query

This query is used to seek out an exact match of a given phrase, where terms in the user-specified phrase appear in the same order in the original text document.

The following example reuses the earlier example of resume text data containing 14 documents to walk through queries. In this sentence, "document" means the column value. The data is stored in the `SKILLS\_COL` column and we have created a text index on this column.

```csv
Java, C++, worked on open source projects, coursera machine learning
Machine learning, Tensor flow, Java, Stanford university,
Distributed systems, Java, C++, Go, distributed query engines for analytics and data warehouses, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, transaction processing
Java, Python, C++, Machine learning, building and deploying large scale production systems, concurrency, multi-threading, CPU processing
C++, Python, Tensor flow, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems, Machine learning
Amazon EC2, AWS, hadoop, big data, spark, building high performance scalable systems, building and deploying large scale production systems, concurrency, multi-threading, Java, C++, CPU processing
Distributed systems, database development, columnar query engine, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems
Distributed systems, Java, realtime streaming systems, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading
CUDA, GPU, Python, Machine learning, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems
Distributed systems, Java, database engine, cluster management, docker image building and distribution
Kubernetes, cluster management, operating systems, concurrency, multi-threading, apache airflow, Apache Spark,

CUDA, GPU processing, Tensor flow, Pandas, Python, Jupyter notebook, spark, Machine learning, building high performance scalable systems
Distributed systems, Apache Kafka, publish-subscribe, building and deploying large scale production systems, concurrency, multi-threading, C++, CPU processing, Java
Realtime stream processing, publish subscribe, columnar processing for data warehouses, concurrency, Java, multi-threading, C++,
C++, Java, Python, realtime streaming systems, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, transaction processing, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading, apache airflow
Databases, columnar query processing, Apache Arrow, distributed systems, Machine learning, cluster management, docker image building and distribution
Database engine, OLAP systems, OLTP transaction processing at large scale, concurrency, multi-threading, GO, building large scale systems
```

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each matching document MUST contain phrase "Distributed systems":

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"Distributed systems"')
```

The search expression is '\\"Distributed systems\\"'

* The search expression is **always specified within single quotes** '\<your expression>'
* Since we are doing a phrase search, the **phrase should be specified within double quotes** inside the single quotes and the **double quotes should be escaped**
  * '\\"\<your phrase>\\"'

The above query will match the following documents:

```csv
Distributed systems, Java, C++, Go, distributed query engines for analytics and data warehouses, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, transaction processing
Distributed systems, database development, columnar query engine, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems
Distributed systems, Java, realtime streaming systems, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading
Distributed systems, Java, database engine, cluster management, docker image building and distribution
Distributed systems, Apache Kafka, publish-subscribe, building and deploying large scale production systems, concurrency, multi-threading, C++, CPU processing, Java
Databases, columnar query processing, Apache Arrow, distributed systems, Machine learning, cluster management, docker image building and distribution
```

But it won't match the following document:

```csv
Distributed data processing, systems design experience
```

This is because the phrase query looks for the phrase occurring in the original document **"as is"**. The terms as specified by the user in phrase should be in the **exact same order in the original document** for the document to be considered as a match.

**NOTE:** Matching is always done in a case-insensitive manner.

The next example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each matching document MUST contain phrase "query processing":

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"query processing"')
```

The above query will match the following documents:

```csv
Apache spark, Java, C++, query processing, transaction processing, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading, apache airflow
Databases, columnar query processing, Apache Arrow, distributed systems, Machine learning, cluster management, docker image building and distribution"
```

### Term query

Term queries are used to search for individual terms.

This example will query the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each matching document MUST contain the term 'Java'.

As mentioned earlier, the search expression is always within single quotes. However, since this is a term query, we don't have to use double quotes within single quotes.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, 'Java')
```

### Composite query using Boolean operators

The Boolean operators `AND` and `OR` are supported and we can use them to build a composite query. Boolean operators can be used to combine phrase and term queries in any arbitrary manner

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each matching document MUST contain the phrases "distributed systems" and "tensor flow". This combines two phrases using the `AND` Boolean operator.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"Machine learning" AND "Tensor Flow"')
```

The above query will match the following documents:

```csv
Machine learning, Tensor flow, Java, Stanford university,
C++, Python, Tensor flow, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems, Machine learning
CUDA, GPU processing, Tensor flow, Pandas, Python, Jupyter notebook, spark, Machine learning, building high performance scalable systems
```

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each document MUST contain the phrase "machine learning" and the terms 'gpu' and 'python'. This combines a phrase and two terms using Boolean operators.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"Machine learning" AND gpu AND python')
```

The above query will match the following documents:

```csv
CUDA, GPU, Python, Machine learning, database kernel, storage, indexing and transaction processing, building large scale systems
CUDA, GPU processing, Tensor flow, Pandas, Python, Jupyter notebook, spark, Machine learning, building high performance scalable systems
```

When using Boolean operators to combine term(s) and phrase(s) or both, note that:

* The matching document can contain the terms and phrases in any order.
* The matching document may not have the terms adjacent to each other (if this is needed, use appropriate phrase query).

Use of the OR operator is implicit. In other words, if phrase(s) and term(s) are not combined using AND operator in the search expression, the OR operator is used by default:

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each document MUST contain ANY one of:

* phrase "distributed systems" OR
* term 'java' OR
* term 'C++'.

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"distributed systems" Java C++')
```

Grouping using parentheses is supported:

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each document MUST contain

* phrase "distributed systems" AND
* at least one of the terms Java or C++

Here the terms Java and C++ are grouped without any operator, which implies the use of OR. The root operator AND is used to combine this with phrase "distributed systems"

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '"distributed systems" AND (Java C++)')
```

### Prefix query

Prefix queries can be done in the context of a single term. We can't use prefix matches for phrases.

This example queries the `SKILL\_COL` column to look for documents where each document MUST contain text like stream, streaming, streams etc

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, 'stream*')
```

The above query will match the following documents:

```csv
Distributed systems, Java, realtime streaming systems, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading
Big data stream processing, Apache Flink, Apache Beam, database kernel, distributed query engines for analytics and data warehouses
Realtime stream processing, publish subscribe, columnar processing for data warehouses, concurrency, Java, multi-threading, C++,
C++, Java, Python, realtime streaming systems, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, transaction processing, distributed storage, concurrency, multi-threading, apache airflow
```

### Regular Expression Query

Phrase and term queries work on the fundamental logic of looking up the terms in the text index. The original text document (a value in the column with text index enabled) is parsed, tokenized, and individual "indexable" terms are extracted. These terms are inserted into the index.

Based on the nature of the original text and how the text is segmented into tokens, it is possible that some terms don't get indexed individually. In such cases, it is better to use regular expression queries on the text index.

Consider a server log as an example where we want to look for exceptions. A regex query is suitable here as it is unlikely that 'exception' is present as an individual indexed token.

Syntax of a regex query is slightly different from queries mentioned earlier. The regular expression is written between a pair of forward slashes (/).

```sql
SELECT SKILLS_COL 
FROM MyTable 
WHERE text_match(SKILLS_COL, '/.*Exception/')
```

The above query will match any text document containing "exception".

### Deciding Query Types

Combining phrase and term queries using Boolean operators and grouping lets you build a complex text search query expression.

The key thing to remember is that phrases should be used when the order of terms in the document is important and when separating the phrase into individual terms doesn't make sense from end user's perspective.

An example would be phrase "machine learning".

```sql
TEXT_MATCH(column, '"machine learning"')
```

However, if we are searching for documents matching Java and C++ terms, using phrase query "Java C++" will actually result in in partial results (could be empty too) since now we are relying the on the user specifying these skills in the exact same order (adjacent to each other) in the resume text.

```sql
TEXT_MATCH(column, '"Java C++"')
```

Term query using Boolean AND operator is more appropriate for such cases

```sql
TEXT_MATCH(column, 'Java AND C++')
```

### Text Index Tuning

To improve Lucene index creation time, some configs have been provided. Field Config properties `luceneUseCompoundFile` and `luceneMaxBufferSizeMB` can provide faster index writing at but may increase file descriptors and/or memory pressure.
