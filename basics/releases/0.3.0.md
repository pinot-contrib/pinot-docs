  0.3.0 release of Apache Pinot introduces the concept of plugins that makes it
  easy to extend and integrate with other systems.
---

# 0.3.0

## What's the big change?

The reason behind the architectural change from the previous release (0.2.0) and this release (0.3.0), is the possibility of extending Apache Pinot. The 0.2.0 release was not flexible enough to support new storage types nor new stream types. Basically, inserting a new functionality required to change too much code. Thus, the Pinot team went through an extensive refactoring and improvement of the source code.

For instance, the picture below shows the module dependencies of the 0.2.X or previous releases. If we wanted to support a new storage type, we would have had to change several modules. Pretty bad, huh?

![0.2.0 and before Pinot Module Dependency Diagram](../../.gitbook/assets/old\_architecture.svg)

In order to conquer this challenge, below major changes are made:

* Refactored common interfaces to `pinot-spi` module
* Concluded four types of modules:
  * Pinot input format: How to read records from various data/file formats: e.g. `Avro`/`CSV`/`JSON`/`ORC`/`Parquet`/`Thrift`
  * Pinot filesystem: How to operate files on various filesystems: e.g. `Azure Data Lake`/`Google Cloud Storage`/`S3`/`HDFS`
  * Pinot stream ingestion: How to ingest data stream from various upstream systems, e.g. `Kafka`/`Kinesis`/`Eventhub`
  * Pinot batch ingestion: How to run Pinot batch ingestion jobs in various frameworks, like `Standalone`, `Hadoop`, `Spark`.
* Built shaded jars for each individual plugin
* Added support to dynamically load pinot plugins at server startup time

Now the architecture supports a **plug-and-play** fashion, where new tools can be supported with little and simple extensions, without affecting big chunks of code. Integrations with new streaming services and data formats can be developed in a much more simple and convenient way.

## **Work in Progress**

* We are in the process of supporting text search query functionalities.
* We are in the process of supporting null value ([#4230](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4230)), currently limited query feature is supported
  * Added Presence Vector to represent null value ([#4585](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4585))
  * Added null predicate support for leaf predicates ([#4943](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4943))

## **Backward Incompatible Changes**

* It’s a disruptive upgrade from version 0.1.0 to this because of the protocol changes between Pinot Broker and Pinot Server. Ensure that you upgrade to release 0.2.0 first, then upgrade to this version.
* If you build your own startable or war without using scripts generated in Pinot-distribution module. For Java 8, an environment variable “plugins.dir” is required for Pinot to find out where to load all the Pinot plugin jars. For Java 11, plugins directory is required to be explicitly set into classpath. See `pinot-admin.sh` as an example.
* As always, we recommend that you upgrade controllers first, and then brokers and lastly the servers in order to have zero downtime in production clusters.
* Kafka 0.9 is no longer included in the release distribution.
* Pull request [#4806](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4806) introduces a backward incompatible API change for segments management.
  * Removed segment toggle APIs
  * Removed list all segments in cluster APIs
  * Deprecated below APIs:
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/metadata`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/crc`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/{segmentName}`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/{segmentName}/metadata`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/{segmentName}/reload`
    * `POST /tables/{tableName}/segments/{segmentName}/reload`
    * `GET /tables/{tableName}/segments/reload`
    * `POST /tables/{tableName}/segments/reload`
* Pull request [#5054](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5054) deprecated below task related APIs:
  * GET:
    * _`/tasks/taskqueues`_: List all task queues
    * `/tasks/taskqueuestate/{taskType}` -> `/tasks/{taskType}/state`
    * `/tasks/tasks/{taskType}` -> `/tasks/{taskType}/tasks`
    * `/tasks/taskstates/{taskType}`  -> `/tasks/{taskType}/taskstates`
    * `/tasks/taskstate/{taskName}` -> `/tasks/task/{taskName}/taskstate`
    * `/tasks/taskconfig/{taskName}` -> `/tasks/task/{taskName}/taskconfig`
  * PUT:
    * `/tasks/scheduletasks` -> **`POST`** `/tasks/schedule`
    * `/tasks/cleanuptasks/{taskType}` -> `/tasks/{taskType}/cleanup`
    * `/tasks/taskqueue/{taskType}`: Toggle a task queue
  * DELETE:
    * `/tasks/taskqueue/{taskType}` -> `/tasks/{taskType}`
* Deprecated modules `pinot-hadoop` and `pinot-spark` and replaced with `pinot-batch-ingestion-hadoop` and `pinot-batch-ingestion-spark`.
* Introduced new Pinot batch ingestion jobs and yaml based job specs to define segment generation jobs and segment push jobs.
*   You may see exceptions like below in pinot-brokers during cluster upgrade, but it's safe to ignore them.
