## Special notes

* Pinot controller metrics prefix is fixed to add a missing dot ([#6499](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6499)). This is a backward-incompatible change that JMX query on controller metrics must be updated
* Legacy group key delimiter (\t) was removed to be backward-compatible with release 0.5.0 ([#6589](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6589))
* Upgrade zookeeper version to 3.5.8 to fix ZOOKEEPER-2184: Zookeeper Client should re-resolve hosts when connection attempts fail. ([#6558](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6558))
* Add TLS-support for client-pinot and pinot-internode connections ([#6418](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6418)) Upgrades to a TLS-enabled cluster can be performed safely and without downtime. To achieve a live-upgrade, go through the following steps:
  * First, configure alternate ingress ports for https/netty-tls on brokers, controllers, and servers. Restart the components with a rolling strategy to avoid cluster downtime.
  * Second, verify manually that https access to controllers and brokers is live. Then, configure all components to prefer TLS-enabled connections (while still allowing unsecured access). Restart the individual components.
  * Third, disable insecure connections via configuration. You may also have to set controller.vip.protocol and controller.vip.port and update the configuration files of any ingestion jobs. Restart components a final time and verify that insecure ingress via http is not available anymore.
* PQL endpoint on Broker is deprecated ([#6607](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6607))
  * Apache Pinot has adopted SQL syntax and semantics. Legacy PQL (Pinot Query Language) is deprecated and no longer supported. Use SQL syntax to query Pinot on broker endpoint /query/sql and controller endpoint /sql

## Major Bug fixes
