# 0.4.0

### Summary

0.4.0 release introduced various new features, including the theta-sketch based distinct count aggregation function, an S3 filesystem plugin, a unified star-tree index implementation, deprecation of TimeFieldSpec in favor of DateTimeFieldSpec, etc. Miscellaneous refactoring, performance improvement and bug fixes were also included in this release.

### Work in Progress

* Upsert: support overriding data in the real-time table (#4261).
  * Add pinot upsert features to pinot common (#5175)
* Enhancements for theta-sketch, e.g. multiValue aggregation support, complex predicates, performance tuning, etc

### Backward Incompatible Changes

* TableConfig no longer support de-serialization from json string of nested json string (i.e. no `\"` inside the json) (#5194)
*   The following APIs are changed in AggregationFunction (use TransformExpressionTree instead of String as the key of blockValSetMap) (#5371):

    ```
    void aggregate(int length, AggregationResultHolder aggregationResultHolder, Map<TransformExpressionTree, BlockValSet> blockValSetMap);
    void aggregateGroupBySV(int length, int[] groupKeyArray, GroupByResultHolder groupByResultHolder, Map<TransformExpressionTree, BlockValSet> blockValSetMap);
    void aggregateGroupByMV(int length, int[][] groupKeysArray, GroupByResultHolder groupByResultHolder, Map<TransformExpressionTree, BlockValSet> blockValSetMap);
    ```
