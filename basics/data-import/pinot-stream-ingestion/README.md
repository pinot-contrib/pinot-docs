# Stream ingestion

Apache Pinot lets users consume data from streams and push it directly into the database, in a process known as stream ingestion. Stream Ingestion makes it possible to query data within seconds of publication.

Stream Ingestion provides support for checkpoints for preventing data loss.

Setting up Stream ingestion involves the following steps:

1. Create schema configuration
2. Create table configuration
3. Upload table and schema spec

Let's take a look at each of the steps in more detail.

Let us assume the data to be ingested is in the following format:

```bash
{"studentID":205,"firstName":"Natalie","lastName":"Jones","gender":"Female","subject":"Maths","score":3.8,"timestamp":1571900400000}
{"studentID":205,"firstName":"Natalie","lastName":"Jones","gender":"Female","subject":"History","score":3.5,"timestamp":1571900400000}
{"studentID":207,"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Lewis","gender":"Male","subject":"Maths","score":3.2,"timestamp":1571900400000}
{"studentID":207,"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Lewis","gender":"Male","subject":"Chemistry","score":3.6,"timestamp":1572418800000}
{"studentID":209,"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Female","subject":"Geography","score":3.8,"timestamp":1572505200000}
{"studentID":209,"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Female","subject":"English","score":3.5,"timestamp":1572505200000}
{"studentID":209,"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Female","subject":"Maths","score":3.2,"timestamp":1572678000000}
{"studentID":209,"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Female","subject":"Physics","score":3.6,"timestamp":1572678000000}
{"studentID":211,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Male","subject":"Maths","score":3.8,"timestamp":1572678000000}
{"studentID":211,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Male","subject":"English","score":3.5,"timestamp":1572678000000}
{"studentID":211,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Male","subject":"History","score":3.2,"timestamp":1572854400000}
{"studentID":212,"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Young","gender":"Male","subject":"History","score":3.6,"timestamp":1572854400000}
```

### Create Schema Configuration

Schema defines the fields along with their data types. The schema also defines whether fields serve as `dimensions` , `metrics` or `timestamp`. For more details on schema configuration, see [creating a schema](../../getting-started/pushing-your-data-to-pinot.md#creating-a-schema).

For our sample data, the schema configuration looks like this:

{% code title="/tmp/pinot-quick-start/transcript-schema.json" %}
```bash
{
  "schemaName": "transcript",
  "dimensionFieldSpecs": [
    {
      "name": "studentID",
      "dataType": "INT"
    },
    {
      "name": "firstName",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "lastName",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "gender",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "subject",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    }
  ],
  "metricFieldSpecs": [
    {
      "name": "score",
      "dataType": "FLOAT"
    }
  ],
  "dateTimeFieldSpecs": [{
    "name": "timestamp",
    "dataType": "LONG",
    "format" : "1:MILLISECONDS:EPOCH",
    "granularity": "1:MILLISECONDS"
  }]
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Create Table Configuration

The next step is to create a table where all the ingested data will flow and can be queried. Unlike batch ingestion, table configuration for real-time ingestion also triggers the data ingestion job. For a more detailed overview of tables, see the [table](../../components/table.md) reference.

The real-time table configuration consists of the following fields:

* **tableName** - The name of the table where the data should flow
* **tableType** - The internal type for the table. Should always be set to `REALTIME` for realtime ingestion
* **segmentsConfig** -
* **tableIndexConfig** - defines which column to use for indexing along with the type of index. For full configuration, see \[Indexing Configs]. It has the following _**required**_ fields -
  * **loadMode** - specifies how the segments should be loaded. Should be`heap` or `mmap`. Here's the difference between both the configs
    * _mmap_: Segments are loaded onto memory-mapped files. This is the default mode.
    * _heap_: Segments are loaded into direct memory. Note, 'heap' here is a legacy misnomer, and it does not imply JVM heap. This mode should only be used when we want faster performance than memory-mapped files, and are also sure that we will never run into OOM.
  * **streamConfig** - specifies the data source along with the necessary configs to start consuming the real-time data. The streamConfig can be thought of as the equivalent to the job spec for batch ingestion. The following options are supported:

| Config key                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Supported values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You can also specify additional configs for the consumer directly into the streamConfigs.

For our sample data and schema, the table config will look like this:

```json
{
  "tableName": "transcript",
  "tableType": "REALTIME",
  "segmentsConfig": {
    "timeColumnName": "timestamp",
    "timeType": "MILLISECONDS",
    "schemaName": "transcript",
    "replicasPerPartition": "1"
  },
  "tenants": {},
  "tableIndexConfig": {
    "loadMode": "MMAP",
    "streamConfigs": {
      "streamType": "kafka",
      "stream.kafka.consumer.type": "lowlevel",
      "stream.kafka.topic.name": "transcript-topic",
      "stream.kafka.decoder.class.name": "org.apache.pinot.plugin.stream.kafka.KafkaJSONMessageDecoder",
      "stream.kafka.consumer.factory.class.name": "org.apache.pinot.plugin.stream.kafka20.KafkaConsumerFactory",
      "stream.kafka.broker.list": "localhost:9876",
      "realtime.segment.flush.threshold.time": "3600000",
      "realtime.segment.flush.threshold.rows": "50000",
      "stream.kafka.consumer.prop.auto.offset.reset": "smallest"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "customConfigs": {}
  }
}
```

### Upload schema and table config

Now that we have our table and schema configurations, let's upload them to the Pinot cluster. As soon as the configs are uploaded, pinot will start ingesting available records from the topic.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
```
docker run \
    --network=pinot-demo \
    -v /tmp/pinot-quick-start:/tmp/pinot-quick-start \
    --name pinot-streaming-table-creation \
    apachepinot/pinot:latest AddTable \
    -schemaFile /tmp/pinot-quick-start/transcript-schema.json \
    -tableConfigFile /tmp/pinot-quick-start/transcript-table-realtime.json \
    -controllerHost pinot-quickstart \
    -controllerPort 9000 \
    -exec
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Launcher Script" %}
```bash
bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable \
    -schemaFile /path/to/transcript-schema.json \
    -tableConfigFile /path/to/transcript-table-realtime.json \
    -exec
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Tuning Stream Config

#### Throttling Stream Consumption

There are some scenarios where the message rate in the input stream has a bursty nature which can lead to long GC pauses on the Pinot servers or affect the ingestion rate of other realtime tables on the same server. In such scenarios, you should throttle the consumption rate during stream ingestion.

Stream consumption throttling can be tuned using the stream config `topic.consumption.rate.limit` which indicates the upper bound on the message rate for the entire topic.

Here is the sample configuration on how to configure the consumption throttling:

```json
{
  "tableName": "transcript",
  "tableType": "REALTIME",
  ...
  "tableIndexConfig": {
    "loadMode": "MMAP",
    "streamConfigs": {
      "streamType": "kafka",
      "stream.kafka.consumer.type": "lowlevel",
      "stream.kafka.topic.name": "transcript-topic",
      ...
      "topic.consumption.rate.limit": 1000
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

Some things to keep in mind while tuning this config are:

1. Since this config applied to the entire topic, internally, this rate is divided by the number of partitions in the topic and applied to each partition's consumer.
2. In case of multi-tenant deployment (where you have more than 1 table in the same server instance), you need to make sure that the rate limit on one table doesn't step on/starve the rate limiting of another table. So, when there is more than 1 table on the same server (which is most likely to happen), you may need to re-tune the throttling threshold for all the streaming tables.

Once throttling is enabled for a table, you can verify by searching for a log that looks similar to:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
A consumption rate limiter is set up for topic <topic_name> in table <tableName> with rate limit: <rate_limit> (topic rate limit: <topic_rate_limit>, partition count: <partition_count>)
```
{% endcode %}

In addition, you can monitor the consumption rate utilization with the metric `COSUMPTION_QUOTA_UTILIZATION`.

Note that any configuration change for `topic.consumption.rate.limit` in the stream config will **NOT** take effect immediately. The new configuration will be picked up from the next consuming segment. In order to enforce the new configuration, you need to trigger forceCommit APIs. Please refer to [Pause Stream Ingestion](./#pause-stream-ingestion) for more details.

```
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/forceCommit
```

### Custom Ingestion Support

We are working on support for other ingestion platforms, but you can also write your own ingestion plugin if it is not supported out of the box. For a walkthrough, see [Stream Ingestion Plugin](../../../developers/plugin-architecture/write-custom-plugins/write-your-stream.md).

### Pause Stream Ingestion

There are some scenarios in which you may want to pause the realtime ingestion while your table is available for queries. For example if there is a problem with the stream ingestion, while you are troubleshooting the issue, you still want the queries to be executed on the already ingested data. For these scenarios, you can first issue a Pause request to a Controller host. After troubleshooting with the stream is done, you can issue another request to Controller to resume the consumption.

```bash
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/pauseConsumption
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/resumeConsumption
```

When a Pause request is issued, Controller instructs the realtime servers hosting your table to commit their consuming segments immediately. However, the commit process may take some time to complete. Please note that Pause and Resume requests are async. OK response means that instructions for pausing or resuming has been successfully sent to the realtime server. If you want to know if the consumptions actually stopped or resumed, you can issue a pause status request.

```bash
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/pauseStatus
```

It's worth noting that consuming segments on realtime servers are stored in volatile memory, and their resources are allocated when the consuming segments are first created. These resources cannot be altered if consumption parameters are changed midway through consumption. It may therefore take hours before these changes take effect. Furthermore, if the parameters are changed in an incompatible way (for example, changing the underlying stream with a completely new set of offsets, or changing the stream endpoint from which to consume messages, etc.), it will result in the table getting into an error state.

Pause and resume feature comes to the rescue here. When a Pause request is issued by the operator, consuming segments are committed without starting new mutables ones. Instead, new mutable segments are started only when the Resume request is issued. This mechanism provides the operators as well as developers with more flexibility. It also enables Pinot to be more resilient to the operational and functional constraints imposed by underlying streams.

There is another feature called "Force Commit" which utilizes the primitives of pause and resume feature. When the operator issues a force commit request, the current mutable segments will be committed and new ones started right away. Operators can now use this feature for all compatible table config parameter changes to take effect immediately.

```bash
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/forceCommit
```

(v 0.12.0+) Once submitted, the forceCommit API returns a jobId that can be used to get the current progress of the forceCommit operation. A sample response and status API call:

```bash
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/forceCommit
{
  "forceCommitJobId": "6757284f-b75b-45ce-91d8-a277bdbc06ae",
  "forceCommitStatus": "SUCCESS",
  "jobMetaZKWriteStatus": "SUCCESS"
}

$ curl -X GET {controllerHost}/tables/forceCommitStatus/6757284f-b75b-45ce-91d8-a277bdbc06ae
{
  "jobId": "6757284f-b75b-45ce-91d8-a277bdbc06ae",
  "segmentsForceCommitted": "[\"airlineStats__0__0__20230119T0700Z\",\"airlineStats__1__0__20230119T0700Z\",\"airlineStats__2__0__20230119T0700Z\"]",
  "submissionTimeMs": "1674111682977",
  "numberOfSegmentsYetToBeCommitted": 0,
  "jobType": "FORCE_COMMIT",
  "segmentsYetToBeCommitted": [],
  "tableName": "airlineStats_REALTIME"
}
```

For incompatible parameter changes, an option is added to the resume request to handle the case of a completely new set of offsets. Operators can now follow a three-step process: First, issue a Pause request. Second, change the consumption parameters. Finally, issue the Resume request with the appropriate option. These steps will preserve the old data and allow the new data to be consumed immediately. All through the operation, queries will continue to be served.

```bash
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/resumeConsumption?resumeFrom=smallest
$ curl -X POST {controllerHost}/tables/{tableName}/resumeConsumption?resumeFrom=largest
```

### Handling partition changes in Streams

If a Pinot table is configured to consume using a [Low Level](./#create-table-configuration) (partition-based) stream type, then it is possible that the partitions of the table change over time. In Kafka, for example, the number of partitions may increase. In Kinesis, the number of partitions may increase _or_ decrease -- some partitions could be merged to create a new one, or existing partitions split to create new ones.

Pinot runs a periodic task called `RealtimeSegmentValidationManager` that monitors such changes and starts consumption on new partitions (or stops consumptions from old ones) as necessary. Since this is a [periodic task](../../components/controller.md#controller-periodic-tasks) that is run on the controller, it may take some time for Pinot to recognize new partitions and start consuming from them. This may delay the data in new partitions appearing in the results that pinot returns.

If it is desired to recognize the new partitions sooner, then you can [manually trigger](../../components/controller.md#running-the-periodic-task-manually) the periodic task so as to recognize such data immediately.

### Inferring Ingestion Status of Realtime Tables

Often, it is important to understand the rate of ingestion of data into your realtime table. This is commonly done by looking at the consumption "lag" of the consumer. The lag itself can be observed in many dimensions. Pinot supports observing consumption lag along the offset dimension and time dimension, whenever applicable (as it depends on the specifics of the connector).

The ingestion status of a connector can be observed by querying either the `/consumingSegmentsInfo` API or the table's `/debug` API, as shown below:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```shell
# GET /tables/{tableName}/consumingSegmentsInfo
curl -X GET "http://<controller_url:controller_admin_port>/tables/meetupRsvp/consumingSegmentsInfo" -H "accept: application/json"

# GET /debug/tables/{tableName}
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/debug/tables/meetupRsvp?type=REALTIME&verbosity=1" -H "accept: application/json"
```
{% endcode %}

A sample response from a Kafka based realtime table is shown below. The ingestion status is displayed for each of the CONSUMING segments in the table.

```json
{
  "_segmentToConsumingInfoMap": {
    "meetupRsvp__0__0__20221019T0639Z": [

        },
        "partitionOffsetInfo": {
          "currentOffsetsMap": {
            "0": "6" // <-- Current consumer position
          },
          "latestUpstreamOffsetMap": {

          },
          "recordsLagMap": {

          },
          "recordsAvailabilityLagMap": {
            "0": "2"  // <-- Lag, in terms of time
          }
        }
      }
    ],
```

| recordsAvailabilityLagMap | (Whenever applicable) Defines how soon after record ingestion was the record consumed by Pinot. This is calculated as the difference between the time the record was consumed and the time at which the record was ingested upstream.                                      |

### Monitoring Realtime Ingestion

Realtime ingestion includes 3 stages of message processing: Decode, Transform and Index.&#x20;

In each of these stages, a failure can happen which may or may not result in an ingestion failure. The following metrics are available to investigation ingestion issues:

1. Decode stage -> error here is recorded as `INVALID_REALTIME_ROWS_DROPPED`
2. Transform stage -> possible errors here are:
   1. When a message gets dropped due to the [FILTER](../../../developers/advanced/ingestion-level-transformations.md#filtering) transform, it is recorded as `REALTIME_ROWS_FILTERED`
   2. When the transform pipeline sets the `$INCOMPLETE_RECORD_KEY$` key in the message, it is recorded as `INCOMPLETE_REALTIME_ROWS_CONSUMED` , only when `continueOnError` configuration is enabled. If the `continueOnError` is not enabled, the ingestion fails.&#x20;
3. Index stage -> When there is failure at this stage, the ingestion typically stops and marks the partition as ERROR.

There is yet another metric called `ROWS_WITH_ERROR` which is the sum of all error counts in the 3 stages above.&#x20;

Furthermore, the metric `REALTIME_CONSUMPTION_EXCEPTIONS` gets incremented whenever there is a transient/permanent stream exception seen during consumption. &#x20;

These metrics can be used to understand why ingestion failed for a particular table partition before diving into the server logs.&#x20;
