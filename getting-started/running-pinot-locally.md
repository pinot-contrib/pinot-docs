# Running Pinot locally

## Video Tutorial

Here's a video tutorial for setting up a Pinot cluster: [How to Setup a Pinot Cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNnwMF0pOJ8).

Alternately, you can follow the step by step guid below.

## Getting Pinot

First, let's get Pinot. You can either build it, or download it

{% hint style="info" %}
 **Prerequisites** 

Install Java 8 or higher.
{% endhint %}

```bash
# define the pinot version 
PINOT_VERSION=0.3.0
```

### Build from source or Download the distribution

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Build from source " %}


Follow these steps to checkout code from [Github](https://github.com/apache/pinot) and build Pinot locally

{% hint style="info" %}
 **Prerequisites** 

Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 3.6 or higher
{% endhint %}

```bash
# checkout pinot
git clone https://github.com/apache/pinot.git
cd pinot

# build pinot
mvn install package -DskipTests -Pbin-dist

# navigate to directory containing the setup scripts
cd build
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Pinot scripts is located under **pinot-distribution/target** not **target** directory under root.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Download the release" %}


Download the latest binary release from [Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/download/), or use this command 

```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/pinot/apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION/apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin.tar.gz
```

Once you have the tar file,

```bash
# untar it
tar -zxvf apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin.tar.gz

# navigate to directory containing the launcher scripts
cd apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to run Pinot using a Docker image instead, head over to [Running Pinot in Docker](running-pinot-in-docker.md)
{% endhint %}

## Setting up a Pinot Cluster

We'll be using a quick-start script, which does the following:

1. Sets up the Pinot cluster `QuickStartCluster`
2. Creates a sample table and loads sample data

There's 3 kinds of quick start

### Batch

Batch quick start creates the pinot cluster, creates an offline table `baseballStats` and pushes sample offline data to the table.

```bash
bin/quick-start-batch.sh
```

That's it! We've spun up a Pinot cluster. You can continue playing with other types of quick start, or simply head on to [Pinot Data Explorer](exploring-pinot.md) to check out the data in the `baseballStats` table.

### Streaming

Streaming quick start sets up a Kafka cluster and pushes sample data to a Kafka topic. Then, it creates the Pinot cluster and creates a realtime table `meetupRSVP` which ingests data from the Kafka topic.

```bash
# stop previous quick start cluster, if any
bin/quick-start-streaming.sh
```

We now have a Pinot cluster with a realtime table! You can head over to  [Pinot Data Explorer](exploring-pinot.md) to check out the data in the `meetupRSVP` table.

### Hybrid

Hybrid quick start sets up a Kafka cluster and pushes sample data to a Kafka topic. Then, it creates the Pinot cluster and creates a hybrid table `airlineStats` . The realtime table ingests data from the Kafka topic. Lastly, sample data is pushed into the offline table.

```bash
# stop previous quick start cluster, if any
bin/quick-start-hybrid.sh
```

Let's head over to [Pinot Data Explorer](exploring-pinot.md) to check out the data we pushed to the `airlineStats` table.
