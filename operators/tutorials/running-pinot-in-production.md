# Running Pinot in Production

## Requirements

You will need the following in order to run pinot in production:

* Hardware for controller/broker/servers as per your load
* Working installation of Zookeeper that Pinot can use. We recommend setting aside a path within zookpeer and including that path in pinot.controller.zkStr. Pinot will create its own cluster under this path (cluster name decided by pinot.controller.helixClusterName)
* Shared storage mounted on controllers (if you plan to have multiple controllers for the same cluster). Alternatively, an implementation of PinotFS that the Pinot hosts have access to.
* HTTP load balancers for spraying queries across brokers (or other mechanism to balance queries)
* HTTP load balancers for spraying controller requests (e.g. segment push, or other controller APIs) or other mechanisms for distribution of these requests.

## Deploying Pinot

In general, when deploying Pinot services, it is best to adhere to a specific ordering in which the various components should be deployed. This deployment order is recommended in case of the scenario that there might be protocol or other significant differences, the deployments go out in a predictable order in which failure due to these changes can be avoided.

The ordering is as follows:

1. pinot-controller
2. pinot-broker
3. pinot-server
4. pinot-minion

## Managing Pinot

Pinot provides a web-based management console and a command-line utility (`pinot-admin.sh`) in order to help provision and manage pinot clusters.

### Pinot Management Console

The web based management console allows operations on tables, tenants, segments and schemas. You can access the console via `http://controller-host:port/help`. The console also allows you to enter queries for interactive debugging. Here are some screen-shots from the console.

### Command line utility (pinot-admin.sh)

The command line utility (`pinot-admin.sh`) can be generated by running `mvn install package -DskipTests -Pbin-dist` in the directory in which you checked out Pinot.

Here is an example of invoking the command to create a pinot segment:

```
$ ./pinot-distribution/target/apache-pinot-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/apache-pinot-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/bin/pinot-admin.sh CreateSegment -dataDir /Users/host1/Desktop/test/ -format CSV -outDir /Users/host1/Desktop/test2/ -tableName baseballStats -segmentName baseballStats_data -overwrite -schemaFile ./pinot-distribution/target/apache-pinot-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/apache-pinot-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/sample_data/baseballStats_schema.json

## Monitoring Pinot

Pinot exposes several metrics to monitor the service and ensure that pinot users are not experiencing issues. In this section we discuss some of the key metrics that are useful to monitor. A full list of metrics is available in the [Metrics](../../configuration-reference/monitoring-metrics.md) section.

### Pinot Server

* Missing Segments - [NUM\_MISSING\_SEGMENTS](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ServerMeter.java)
  * Number of missing segments that the broker queried for (expected to be on the server) but the server didn’t have. This can be due to retention or stale routing table.
* Query latency - [TOTAL\_QUERY\_TIME](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ce2d9ee9dc73b2d7273a63a4eede774eb024ea8f/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ServerQueryPhase.java)
  * Total time to take from receiving to finishing executing the query.
* Query Execution Exceptions - [QUERY\_EXECUTION\_EXCEPTIONS](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ServerMeter.java)
  * The number of exception which might have occurred during query execution.
* Real-time Consumption Status - [LLC\_PARTITION\_CONSUMING](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ServerGauge.java)
  * This gives a binary value based on whether low-level consumption is healthy (1) or unhealthy (0). It’s important to ensure at least a single replica of each partition is consuming.
* Real-time Highest Offset Consumed - [HIGHEST\_STREAM\_OFFSET\_CONSUMED](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ServerGauge.java)
  * The highest offset which has been consumed so far.

### Pinot Broker

* Incoming queries - [QUERIES](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
  * Queries received by a broker.
* Access denied - [REQUEST\_DROPPED\_DUE\_TO\_ACCESS\_ERROR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
  * Queries dropped due to access restrictions.
* Partial Responses
  * Unavailable segments - [BROKER\_RESPONSES\_WITH\_UNAVAILABLE\_SEGMENTS](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
    * Queries with some segments unavailable (no active server hosting them).
  * Partial servers responded- [BROKER\_RESPONSES\_WITH\_PARTIAL\_SERVERS\_RESPONDED](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
    * Queries with not all servers responded.
  * Processing exceptions - [BROKER\_RESPONSES\_WITH\_PROCESSING\_EXCEPTIONS](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
    * Queries with processing exceptions (including server side exceptions, unavailable segments, partial servers responded).
  * Groups limit reached - [BROKER\_RESPONSES\_WITH\_NUM\_GROUPS\_LIMIT\_REACHED](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
    * Queries with `numGroupsLimit` reached. See [Grouping Algorithm](../../users/user-guide-query/grouping-algorithm.md) for more details.
* Table QPS quota exceeded - [QUERY\_QUOTA\_EXCEEDED](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerMeter.java)
  * Binary metric which will indicate when the configured QPS quota for a table is exceeded (1) or if there is capacity remaining (0).
* Table QPS quota usage percent - [QUERY\_QUOTA\_CAPACITY\_UTILIZATION\_RATE](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/BrokerGauge.java)
  * Percentage of the configured QPS quota being utilized.

### Pinot Controller

Many of the controller metrics include a table name and thus are dynamically generated in the code. The metrics below point to the classes which generate the corresponding metrics.

To get the real metric name, the easiest route is to spin up a controller instance, create a table with the desired name and look through the generated metrics.

Todo

Give a more detailed explanation of how metrics are generated, how to identify real metrics names and where to find them in the code.

* Percent Segments Available - [PERCENT\_SEGMENTS\_AVAILABLE](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ce2d9ee9dc73b2d7273a63a4eede774eb024ea8f/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ControllerGauge.java)
  * Percentage of complete online replicas in external view as compared to replicas in ideal state.
* Segments in Error State - [SEGMENTS\_IN\_ERROR\_STATE](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ce2d9ee9dc73b2d7273a63a4eede774eb024ea8f/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ControllerGauge.java)
  * Number of segments in an `ERROR` state for a given table.
* Last push delay - Generated in the [ValidationMetrics](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/ce2d9ee9dc73b2d7273a63a4eede774eb024ea8f/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ValidationMetrics.java) class.
  * The time in hours since the last time an offline segment has been pushed to the controller.
* Percent of replicas up - [PERCENT\_OF\_REPLICAS](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ControllerGauge.java)
  * Percentage of complete online replicas in external view as compared to replicas in ideal state.
* Table storage quota usage percent - [TABLE\_STORAGE\_QUOTA\_UTILIZATION](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/metrics/ControllerGauge.java)
  * Shows how much of the table’s storage quota is currently being used, metric will a percentage of a the entire quota.&#x20;
