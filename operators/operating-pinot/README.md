# Deployment and Monitoring

There are multiple different sections in the documentation to help you get started with operating a Pinot cluster. If you are new to Pinot, start with the basics.

{% content-ref url="../../basics/concepts.md" %}
[concepts.md](../../basics/concepts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../basics/architecture.md" %}
[architecture.md](../../basics/architecture.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

To get started with operating a Pinot cluster, first look at the tutorials in [Getting Started](../../basics/getting-started/) on how to run a basic pinot cluster in various environments.

{% content-ref url="../../basics/getting-started/running-pinot-locally.md" %}
[running-pinot-locally.md](../../basics/getting-started/running-pinot-locally.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../basics/getting-started/kubernetes-quickstart.md" %}
[kubernetes-quickstart.md](../../basics/getting-started/kubernetes-quickstart.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can then proceed to the more advanced Pinot setup in production environment.

{% content-ref url="../tutorials/running-pinot-in-production.md" %}
