# Rebalance Servers

The rebalance operation is used to recompute the assignment of brokers or servers in the cluster. This is not a single command, but rather a series of steps that need to be taken.

In the case of servers, rebalance operation is used to balance the distribution of the segments amongst the servers being used by a Pinot table. This is typically done after capacity changes or config changes such as replication or segment assignment strategies or table migration to a different tenant.

## Changes that require a rebalance

Below are changes that need to be followed by a rebalance.

1. Capacity changes
2. Increasing/decreasing replication for a table
3. Changing segment assignment for a table
4. Moving table from one tenant to a different tenant

### Capacity changes

These are typically done when downsizing/uplifting a cluster or replacing nodes of a cluster.

#### Tenants and tags

Every server added to the Pinot cluster, has tags associated with it. A group of servers with the same tag forms a Server Tenant.

By default, a server in the cluster gets added to the `DefaultTenant` i.e. gets tagged as `DefaultTenant_OFFLINE` and `DefaultTenant_REALTIME`.

Below is an example of how this looks in the znode, as seen in ZooInspector.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-09-08 at 2.05.29 PM.png>)

A Pinot table config has a tenants section, to define the tenant to be used by the table. The Pinot table will use all the servers which belong to the tenant as described in this config. For more details about this, see the [Tenants](../../../basics/components/cluster/tenant.md) section.

```
 {   
    "tableName": "myTable_OFFLINE",
    "tenants" : {
      "broker":"DefaultTenant",
      "server":"DefaultTenant"
    }
  }
```

#### Updating tags

_**0.6.0 onwards**_

In order to change the server tags, the following API can be used.

`PUT /instances/{instanceName}/updateTags?tags=<comma separated tags>`

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-09-08 at 2.29.44 PM.png>)

_**0.5.0 and prior**_

UpdateTags API is not available in 0.5.0 and prior. Instead, use this API to update the Instance.

`PUT /instances/{instanceName}`

For example,

```
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9000/instances/Server_10.1.10.51_7000" 
    -H "accept: application/json" 
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
    -d "{ \"host\": \"10.1.10.51\", \"port\": \"7000\", \"type\": \"SERVER\", \"tags\": [ \"newName_OFFLINE\", \"DefaultTenant_REALTIME\" ]}"
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**NOTE**

The output of GET and input of PUT don't match for this API. Please make sure to use the right payload as shown in example above. Particularly, notice that instance name "Server\_host\_port" gets split up into their own fields in this PUT API.
{% endhint %}

When upsizing/downsizing a cluster, you will need to make sure that the host names of servers are consistent. You can do this by setting the following config parameter:

```
pinot.set.instance.id.to.hostname=true
```

### Replication changes

In order to change the replication factor of a table, update the table config as follows:

OFFLINE table - update the `replication` field

REALTIME table - update the `replicasPerPartition` field

### Segment Assignment changes

The most common segment assignment change is moving from the default segment assignment to replica group segment assignment. Discussing the details of the segment assignment is beyond the scope of this page. More details can be found in [Routing](../tuning/routing.md) and in this [FAQ question](../../../basics/getting-started/frequent-questions/#docs-internal-guid-3eddb872-7fff-0e2a-b4e3-b1b43454add3).

### Table Migration to a different tenant

In a scenario where you need to move table across tenants, for e.g table was assigned earlier to a different Pinot tenant and now you want to move it to a separate one, then you need to call the rebalance API with reassignInstances set to true.

## Rebalance Algorithms

Currently, two rebalance algorithms are supported; one is the default algorithm and the other one is minimal data movement algorithm.

### The Default Algorithm

This algorithm is used for most of the cases. When `reassignInstances` parameter is set to true, the final lists of instance assignment will be re-computed, and the list of instances is sorted per partition per replica group. Whenever the table rebalance is run, segment assignment will respect the sequence in the sorted list and pick up the relevant instances.

### Minimal Data Movement Algorithm

This algorithm focuses more on minimizing the data movement during table rebalance. When `reassignInstances` parameter is set to true and this algorithm gets enabled, the position of instances which are still alive remains the same, and vacant seats are filled with newly added instances or last instances in the existing alive instance candidate. So only the instances which change the position will involve in data movement.

In order to switch to this table rebalance algorithm, just simply set the following config to the table config before triggering table rebalance:

```
"instanceAssignmentConfigMap": {
  ...
  "OFFLINE": {
    ...
    "replicaGroupPartitionConfig": {
      ...
      "minimizeDataMovement": true,
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

When `instanceAssignmentConfigMap` is not explicitly configured, `minimizeDataMovement` flag can also be set into the `segmentsConfig`:

```
"segmentsConfig": {
    ...
    "minimizeDataMovement": true,
    ...
}
```

## Running a Rebalance

After any of the above described changes are done, a rebalance is needed to make those changes take effect.

To run a rebalance, use the following API.

`POST /tables/{tableName}/rebalance?type=<OFFLINE/REALTIME>`

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-09-08 at 2.53.48 PM.png>)

This API has a lot of parameters to control its behavior. Make sure to go over them and change the defaults as needed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**

Typically, the flags that need to be changed from defaults are

**includeConsuming=true** for REALTIME

**downtime=true** if you have only 1 replica, or prefer faster rebalance at the cost of a momentary downtime
