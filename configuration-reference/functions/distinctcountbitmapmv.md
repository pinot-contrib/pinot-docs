## Usage Examples

These examples are based on the [Hybrid Quick Start](../../basics/getting-started/quick-start.md#hybrid).

```sql
select DISTINCTCOUNTBITMAPMV(DivLongestGTimes) AS value
from airlineStats 
where arraylength(DivLongestGTimes) > 1
```

```sql
select DISTINCTCOUNTBITMAPMV(DivTailNums) AS value
from airlineStats 
where arraylength(DivTailNums) > 1
