# Monitoring Metrics

Pinot provides metrics out of the box so that you can monitor every aspect of performance and robustness of the Pinot cluster. Most of the metrics are available either at table level or instance level. There are three main categories of metrics:

* **Gauge** – A single value at any point in time
* **Meter** – Rates of the metric per unit of time
* **Timer** – Record durations and can be used to fetch average duration per unit of time, percentile values, minimum or maximum values, etc.

### Pinot Server

<table><thead><tr><th>Metric Name</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="select">Metric type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>LLC-PARTITION-CONSUMING</td><td>This gives a binary value based on whether low-level consumption is healthy (1) or unhealthy (0). It’s important to ensure at least a single replica of each partition is consuming.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HIGHEST-STREAM-OFFSET-CONSUMED</td><td>The highest offset which has been consumed so far</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>DOCUMENT_COUNT</td><td>total number of records in table</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SEGMENT_COUNT</td><td>total number of segments in table</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>UPSERT_PRIMARY_KEYS_COUNT</td><td>total unique primary keys in table</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LAST_REALTIME_SEGMENT_CREATION_DURATION_SECONDS</td><td>time in seconds it took for latest real-time segment to get created</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LAST_REALTIME_SEGMENT_CREATION_WAIT_TIME_SECONDS</td><td>time in seconds it took for segment creation to start (generally due to waiting for a lock to get acquired)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LAST_REALTIME_SEGMENT_INITIAL_CONSUMPTION_DURATION_SECONDS</td><td>time in seconds spent consuming records for latest segment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LAST_REALTIME_SEGMENT_CATCHUP_DURATION_SECONDS</td><td>time in seconds spent on catching up to the latest offset in metadata. This can happen when multiple servers are consuming from same partition.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LAST_REALTIME_SEGMENT_COMPLETION_DURATION_SECONDS</td><td>time in seconds between when we stopped consuming records and when the segment gets committed</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>REALTIME_OFFHEAP_MEMORY_USED</td><td>off heap memory in bytes current used by real-time segments</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>REALTIME_SEGMENT_NUM_PARTITIONS</td><td>Number of partitions for a table</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LLC_SIMULTANEOUS_SEGMENT_BUILDS</td><td>Number of segments being built currently</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>REALTIME_INGESTION_DELAY_MS</td><td>Per partition metric that measures the delay in milliseconds from the time an event was produced to the stream that feeds Pinot until the event was consumed by Pinot. Partitions that are not actively consuming due to lack of events will report 0 delay. Partitions that are stuck or falling behind will report their last measured delay aged by the time since the sample was taken: this enables the user to monitor partitions that have events queued but where Pinot is falling behind in consumption. This metric assumes event timestamps is UTC time zone, if timestamps are using other timezones, the delay shown will be offset.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ROWS_WITH_ERRORS</td><td>number of rows that either didn't get transformed or didn't get indexed.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>REALTIME_ROWS_CONSUMED</td><td>total number of records consumed from input</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>INVALID_REALTIME_ROWS_DROPPED</td><td>number of records that were filtered based on FilterConfig specified in table config</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>REALTIME_CONSUMPTION_EXCEPTIONS</td><td>number of rows that were not consumed because of some exception.

This can be due to retention or stale routing table</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NO_TABLE_ACCESS</td><td>number of query requests for which table access was denied either due to table not being present or access control restrictions.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HELIX_ZOOKEEPER_RECONNECTS</td><td>Number of times Server instance re-connected to zookeeper.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NETTY_CONNECTION_BYTES_RECEIVED</td><td>total bytes received by the server</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NETTY_CONNECTION_BYTES_SENT</td><td>total bytes sent by the server</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NETTY_CONNECTION_RESPONSES_SENT</td><td>total responses sent by the server</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FRESHNESS_LAG_MS</td><td>time period between when the data was last updated in the table and the current time</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NETTY_CONNECTION_SEND_RESPONSE_LATENCY</td><td>time spent in sending response to brokers after the results are available</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EXECUTION_THREAD_CPU_TIME_NS</td><td>time spent by all threads processing query and results (doesn't includes time spent in system activities)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SYSTEM_ACTIVITIES_CPU_TIME_NS</td><td>time spent in nanoseconds processing query on the servers (only counts system acitivities such as GC, OS paging etc.)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RESPONSE_SER_CPU_TIME_NS</td><td>time spent in nanoseconds serializing query response on servers</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL_CPU_TIME_NS</td><td>total time spent in nanoseconds processing query on the servers</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>END_TO_END_REALTIME_INGESTION_DELAY_MS</td><td>When supported by the underlying stream, this metric provides the ingestion delay in milliseconds from the time an event was ingested by the first stream in your ingestion pipeline to the time the event was ingested by Pinot. The metric is not emitted when the underlying stream does not support this feature. The metric relies on this metric being in UTC time zone. If your time stamp is in another time zone, your metric will be offset accordingly.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
