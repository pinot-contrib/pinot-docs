# Controller Admin API

The [Pinot Admin UI](http://localhost:9000/help) contains all the APIs that you will need to operate and manage your cluster. It provides a set of APIs for Pinot cluster management including health check, instances management, schema and table management, data segments management.

Note: The controller API's are primarily for admin tasks. Even though the UI console queries Pinot when running queries from the query console, use the [Broker Query API](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/api/querying-pinot-using-standard-sql) for querying Pinot.

Let's check out the tables in this cluster by going to [Table -> List all tables in cluster](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Table/listTableConfigs) and click on `Try it out!`. We can see the `baseballStats` table listed here. We can also see the exact `curl` call made to the controller API.

You can look at the configuration of this table by going to [Tables -> Get/Enable/Disable/Drop a table](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Table/alterTableStateOrListTableConfig), type in `baseballStats` in the table name, and click `Try it out!`

Let's check out the schemas in the cluster by going to [Schema -> List all schemas in the cluster](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Schema/listSchemaNames) and click `Try it out!`. We can see a schema called `baseballStats` in this list.

Take a look at the schema by going to [Schema -> Get a schema](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Schema/getSchema), type `baseballStats` in the schema name, and click `Try it out!`.

Finally, let's checkout the data segments in the cluster by going to [List all segments](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Segment/getSegments), type in `baseballStats` in the table name, and click `Try it out!`. There's 1 segment for this table, called `baseballStats_OFFLINE_0`.

You might have figured out by now, in order to get data into the Pinot cluster, we need a table, a schema and segments. Let's head over to [Batch upload sample data](../../basics/getting-started/pushing-your-data-to-pinot.md), to find out more about these components and learn how to create them for your own data.
