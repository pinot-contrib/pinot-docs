# Minus relational operator

The minus operator is used to subtract the result of one query from another query.
This operator is used to find the difference between two sets of rows.

## Implementation details

The minus operator is a semi-blocking operator that first consumes the right input relation in a blocking fashion
and then consumes the left input relation in a streaming fashion.

The current implementation consumes the whole right input relation first and stores the rows in a set.
Then it consumes the left input relation one block at a time.
Each time a block of rows is read from the left input relation, the operator checks if the rows are in the set of rows
from the right input relation.
All unique rows that are not in the set are added to a new partial result block.
Once the whole left input block is analyzed, the operator emits the partial result block.

This process is repeated until all rows from the left input relation are processed.

### Blocking nature
The intersect operator is a semi-blocking operator that first consumes the right input relation in a blocking fashion
and then consumes the left input relation in a streaming fashion.

In pseudo-code, the algorithm looks like this:

```
HashSet<Row> rightRows = new HashSet<>();
Block rightBlock = rightInput.nextBlock();
while (rightBlock is not EOS) {
    rightRows.addAll(rightBlock.getRows());
    rightBlock = rightInput.nextBlock();
}
Block leftBlock = leftInput.nextBlock();
while (leftBlock is not EOS) {
    Block partialResultBlock = new Block();
    for (Row row : leftBlock.getRows()) {
        if (rightRows.add(row)) {
            partialResultBlock.add(row);
        }
    }
    emit partialResultBlock;
    leftBlock = leftInput.nextBlock();
}
emit EOS
```

## Hints
None

## Stats
### executionTimeMs
Type: Long

The summation of time spent by all threads executing the operator.
This means that the wall time spent in the operation may be smaller that this value if the parallelism is larger than 1.

### emittedRows
Type: Long

The number of groups emitted by the operator.

## Tips and tricks

### Memory pressure
The minus operator ends up having to store all unique rows from both input relations in memory.
This can lead to memory pressure if the input relations are large and have a high number of unique rows.

### The order of input relations matter
Although the minus operator ends up adding all unique rows from both input relations to a set, the order of input 
relations matters.
While the right input relation is consumed in a blocking fashion, the left input relation is consumed in a streaming 
fashion.
Therefore the latency of the whole query could be improved if the left input relation is producing values in streaming
fashion.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case one of the input is blocking and the other is not, it is recommended to use the blocking relation as the right
input relation.
