# Transform relational operator

The transform operator is used to apply a transformation to the input data.
They may filter out columns or add new ones by applying functions to the existing columns.
This operator is generated by the multi-stage query engine when you use a _select_ operation in a query, but
can also be used to implement other transformations.

## Implementation details
Transform operators apply some transformation functions to the input data received from upstream.
The cost of the transformation usually depends on the complexity of the functions applied, but comparing to other
operators, it is usually not very high.

### Blocking nature
The transform operator is a streaming operator. 
It emits the blocks of rows as soon as they are received from the upstream operator.


## Hints
None

## Stats
### executionTimeMs
Type: Long

The summation of time spent by all threads executing the operator.
This means that the wall time spent in the operation may be smaller that this value if the parallelism is larger than 1.

### emittedRows
Type: Long

The number of groups emitted by the operator.
