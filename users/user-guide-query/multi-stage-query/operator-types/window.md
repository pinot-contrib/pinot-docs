# Window relational operator

The window operator is used to define a window over which to perform calculations. 

This page describes the window operator defined in the relational algebra used by multi-stage queries.
This operator is generated by the multi-stage query engine when you _window functions_ in a query.
You can read more about window functions in the [window functions](window-functions.md) reference documentation.

## Implementation details

### Blocking nature

## Hints
None

## Stats
### executionTimeMs
Type: Long

The summation of time spent by all threads executing the operator.
This means that the wall time spent in the operation may be smaller that this value if the parallelism is larger than 1.
This number is affected by the number of received rows and the complexity of the window function.

### emittedRows
Type: Long

The number of groups emitted by the operator.
A large number of emitted rows can indicate that the query is not well optimized.

Unlike the [aggregate operator](aggregate.md), which will output one row per group, the window operator will output as 
many rows as input rows.
