# Multi-stage operators

The multi-stage query engine uses a set of operators to process the query.
These operators are based on the relational algebra, with some modifications to better fit the distributed nature of the
engine.

These operators are the execution units that Pinot use to execute a query.
The operators are executed in a pipeline with tree structure, where each operator consumes the output of the previous
operators (also known as _upstreams_).

## Operators vs SQL clauses
These operators are generated from the SQL query that you write, but even they are similar, there is not a one-to-one
mapping between the SQL clauses and the operators.
Some SQL clauses generate multiple operators, while some operators are generated by multiple SQL clauses.

## Operators vs explain plan nodes
Operators and explain plan nodes are closer than SQL clauses and operators.
Although most explain plan nodes can be directly mapped to an operator, there are some exceptions:
* Each `PinotLogicalExchange` and each `PinotLogicalSortExchange` explain node is materialized into 
  a pair of [mailbox send](mailbox-send.md) and [mailbox receive](mailbox-receive.md) operators.
* All plan nodes that belong to the same leaf stage are executed in the [leaf](leaf.md) operator.

In general terms, the operators are the execution units that Pinot uses to execute a query and are also known as the
multi-stage physical plan, while the explain plan nodes are logical plans.
The difference between the two is that the operators can be actually executed, while the explain plan nodes are
the logical representation of the query plan.

## List of operators
The following is a list of operators that are used by the multi-stage query engine:
* [Aggregate](aggregate.md)
* [Filter](filter.md)
* [Hash Join](hash_join.md)
* [Intersect](intersect.md)
* [Leaf](leaf.md)
* [Mailbox Receive](mailbox-receive.md)
* [Mailbox Send](mailbox-send.md)
* [Minus](minus.md)
* [Sort or Limit](sortOrLimit.md)
* [Transform](transform.md)
* [Union](union.md)
* [Window](window.md)
